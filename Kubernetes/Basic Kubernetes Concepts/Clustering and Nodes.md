# Clustering and Nodes
[[Kubernetes]] implements a clustered architecture as in a production environment you will typically have multiple servers to run your containers

These servers are called nodes.

A Kubernetes cluster has one or more control servers which manage and control the cluster and host the Kubernetes API. These servers are usually separate from worker nodes which run the applications within the cluster.
