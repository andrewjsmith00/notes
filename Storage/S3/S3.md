# S3
S3 is one of the oldest AWS services. S3 stands for Simple Storage Service and it provides secure, durable and highly scalable object storage. You are able to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a low cost. You can upload any type of file you can think of.

## Basics
Unlimited Storage

Objects up to 5 TB in size

Store files in a bucket.

## Working with S3 buckets
1. Universal namespace. Each bucket is globally unique
2. When you upload a file to an S3 bucket, you receive an HTTP 200 code


S3 works off a key-value store with the key being the name and the value being the data itself. There is also the version ID when versioning enabled and metadata. S3 spreads data across multiple devices and facilities to ensure availability and durability.


## Securing your data
S3 offers server side encryption, access control lists and bucket policies to secure access. Access control lists can be applied to individual objects and policies apply to the entire bucket,

S3 has a strong read-after-write consistency
