One feature of [[Machine Learning/PyTorch/PyTorch]] is the automatic computation of gradients. This is a standard feature in [[Deep Learning]] toolkits.

Computing gradients manually was painful as derivatives for all functions needed to be calculate. Now with automatic computation, it can be as simple as defining it from building blocks.
