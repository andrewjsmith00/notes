Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of network where there is a state maintained between inputs. This is useful when working with sequence data.

In [[Machine Learning/PyTorch/PyTorch|PyTorch]], this is implemented with the `nn.RNN` class

There are different types of architectures for working with recurrent neural networks. These are:
- [[Sequence-to-sequence]]
- [[Encoder-Decoder]]
- [[Sequence-to-Vector]]
- [[Vector-to-Sequence]]
