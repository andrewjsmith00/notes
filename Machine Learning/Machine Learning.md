# Machine Learning
Developing an algorithm to learn results based off of trained data.


Machine learning is a discipline where a program is defined not by writing it, but by learning from data. [[Deep Learning]] is a speciality within this where [[neural networks]] are used with multiple layers. 

The goal is to produce a program, called a model that given an image will make an accurate prediction based on what the image is.

Every model starts with choosing an architecture. The process of training is finding a set of parameter values that specialise the architecture into a model that works well for the data. To define how well a model does on a prediction, a [[Loss Function]] is used.
