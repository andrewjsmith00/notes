The sigmoid function is a type of [[Activation Functions]] used for [[Binary Classification]]. This changes a 1-dimensional [[Tensors]] input into a decimal value between 0 and 1. The class can be inferred by looking at >0.5.


In [[Software Development/Python/ML Frameworks/PyTorch/PyTorch|PyTorch]] this is the `nn.Sigmoid` class.
