## Concepts
A model is the result of taking [[Machine Learning Algorithms]] and training it on data to produce a mathematical formula that can provide predictions about a task.

## Developing a good model
1. What do we need? [[Forecasting]]? [[Classification]]? etc. 
	- This determines the algorithms that can be selected and what type of data is needed
2. Do we need machine learning?
	- Is there something else that can be used instead of machine learning to get the results? This helps to save effort and time. 
3. How will inferences be served?
	- Real time or batch?
4. What do we have to work with?
	- What data is there? Is there enough? Is it good?
5. How can I tell if it is working?
	- How do we measure the performance?

Start with what we want to achieve and then work backwards.

## Choosing the right approach
The problem will not always require machine learning. Therefore we should look at other approaches as well. For example in predicting deceleration, we can look at formulas that exist instead of using [[Machine Learning]].
We can even put multiple algorithms together a system.
