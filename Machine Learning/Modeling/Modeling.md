## Concepts
A model is the result of taking a machine learning algorithm and training it on data to produce a mathematical formula that can provide predictions about a task.

## Developing a good model
1. What do we need? Forecasting? Classification? etc.
	- This determines the algorithms that can be selected and what type of data is needed
2. Do we need machine learning?
	- Is there something else that can be used instead of machine learning to get the results? This helps to save effort and time. 
3. How will inferences be served?
	- Real time or batch?
4. What do we have to work with?
	- What data is there? Is there enough? Is it
1. How can I tell if it is working?
