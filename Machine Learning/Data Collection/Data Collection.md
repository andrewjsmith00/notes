# Data Collection
## Concepts
Before starting ask:
1. What generalisation is needed?
2. Do we need ML?
3. How will it be used?
4. What is there to work with?
5. How can I tell if it is working?

Ideally, data would be structured well and good to go. Normally it needs some work in order to get the format we need. Sometimes its just garbage.

You can compare them with:
1. Size of the dataset. More = better
2. Attributes. Precision, feature richness. Important features are what is trained on
3. Complete data with no missing. Missing can skew
4. Consistent values. Cleaner = better
5. Distribution of outcomes is equal. Better learning
6. Fair sampling. Otherwise can skew results

Ideally, aim to have as many as 10x the number of data points as there are features.

No matter how you get the data, you want a single place for it to be in.
