Ensembling is where we combine multiple [[Machine Learning Algorithms]] into what appears to be a single model to retrieve a result.

For example, we can take a Logistic Regression model, K-Nearest Neighbours model and Decision tree classifier and combine them by using some other layer. This could be a voting layer where the outputs are used as ‘votes’ to determine the final result.
