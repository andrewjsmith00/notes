$$y = 2x + 3$$
If given $x$, we can figure out $y$ and vice versa. We can plot this and draw a line to predict the $x$ or $y$ value.

## [[Linear Learner]]
[[Supervised learning]] algorithms for regression, [[binary classification]] or [[multi class classification]] problems. You give $x$ as the input and $y$ as the expected output and the algorithm will try to estimate an equation based on the data given.


With regression, we know there is a relationship between $y$ and $x$ and we will try to minimise the error through a technique like [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]] until we reach a satisfiable point.
