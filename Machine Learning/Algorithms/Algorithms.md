Algorithms are *unambiguous* specifications of how to solve a class of problems. They are a repeatable set of steps to solve a problem with the same outcome.

## Why are they used in machine learning?
Bias is a bad thing to have. Heuristics will tend to be based on prior decisions. Computers can't make those assumptions so getting the repeatable generalisations is better.

Bias can always come through via the data or something else.
