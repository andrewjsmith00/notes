[[Supervised learning]] algorithms for [[Regression]], [[Binary Classification]] or [[Multi Class Classification]] problems. You give $x$ as the input and $y$ as the expected output and the algorithm will try to estimate an equation based on the data given.

To estimate this data, these equations will try and fit a linear function to the input data to produce the $y$ value typically through [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]].


It does not work well with missing values
