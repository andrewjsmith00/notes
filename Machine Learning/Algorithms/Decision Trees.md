# Decision Trees
Decision trees are a predictive modelling approach.

Decision trees are machine learning models in tree structures. 
It is a supervised learning algorithm where each non-leaf node is a decision between a set of choices and leaf nodes are the final decision.

There are two types of decision trees:
- [[Classification]] tree (classify object)
- [[Regression]] tree (provide real number)

## Benefits
- Simple
- Interpretable (mirror human decision making)
- Numerical and categorical data
- Minimal data preparation
- Perform well with large datasets
