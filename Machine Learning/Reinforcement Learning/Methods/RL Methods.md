All methods in [[Reinforcement Learning]] come under:
- [[Model-Free Method]] or [[Model-Based Method]]
	- Both of these methods have strengths and weaknesses. Usually model-based methods will appear in deterministic environments like board games. Model-free methods are usually easier to train as it is hard to build good models of complex environments with rich observations.
- [[Value-Based Method]] or [[Policy-Based Method]]
- [[On-Policy Method]] or [[Off-Policy Method]]
