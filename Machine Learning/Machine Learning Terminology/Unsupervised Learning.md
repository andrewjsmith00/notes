Unsupervised leaning is a [[Machine Learning]] method which attempts to learn a hidden structure of a dataset without any prior labelling or supervision of the data. One common example is [[Clustering]] of data to group a set of data into different clusters to reveal relationships, such as similar images or texts.

Another method is [[Machine Learning/Machine Learning Terminology/Generative Adversarial Networks]]. This is where you have two competing [[Neural Networks]] where one is trying to generate fake data to fool the second. The second network tries to discriminate artificial data from the real data. Over time, both networks get better at their tasks by capturing subtleties in the dataset.
