Supervised learning is the most studied and most well known [[Machine Learning]] problem. It deals with the idea if, given an input and the corresponding output, how can we build an algorithm to map the input to the output given the examples. This includes many problems like:
- [[Text Classification]]
- [[Image Classification]]
- [[Regression]]
- [[Sentiment Analysis]]

While these all look quite different, they share the same idea of wanting to learn how to generate the output for an unseen input given known inputs and outputs.
