Overfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training for [[Machine Learning]]. It can be easy to make a model that can predict on the exact data it was trained on but much harder to make accurate predictions on the data it has never seen before.

There any many methods to avoid overfitting, however you should only use these methods after you can confirm that overfitting is occurring.

Indicates by high testing error but low training error.

## Prevention
1. Add more data
2. Stop early
3. Add some noise
4. Use [[Regularisation]]
5. [[Ensemble Learning]]
6. [[Feature Selection]]
