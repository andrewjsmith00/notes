## Some jargon:
Some terminology in deep learning:
- Function form of the model is the *architecture*
- Weights are *parameters*
- *Predictions* are calculated from the *independent variable* which is the data not including the labels
- The *results* of the model are *predictions*
- The measure of performance is the *loss*
- The loss depends not only on predictions but also on the correct labels (also known as targets or the *dependent variable*)
