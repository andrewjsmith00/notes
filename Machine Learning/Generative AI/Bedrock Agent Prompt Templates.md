[[Bedrock Agents]] allow you to modify the prompt templates which outline how the agent constructs prompts to send to the backend [[Foundation Model]].

You can modify the prompt templates to tweak performance and improve accuracy, for example by incorporating [[Few-shot Prompting]] which is where you can improve model performance by providing labeled examples for a specific task.

In your prompt template you include the tools, functions, conversation history and other information that can be dynamically filled out.
