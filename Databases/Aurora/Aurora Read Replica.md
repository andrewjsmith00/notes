You can configure up to 15 read replicas for [[Aurora]] databases. When you write to the cluster, you use the cluster endpoint which will automatically direct to the master node, whichever that is at the time. There is a read endpoint which directs to any of the read replicas.

In the event the master fails, the cluster endpoint reconfigures to point to an existing read replica. The failed master is then added as a read replica once recovered.
