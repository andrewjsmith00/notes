Transforming features so that they are ready for [[Machine Learning Algorithms]]. Ensures relevant features are used. This can involve changing features, replacing missing values, or anything else for shaping a dataset for machine learning.

Feature Engineering usually has multiple layers of transformations done to properly prepare the data.

## Other types
### Image Feature Engineering
Extracting useful information from an image through transforming it. 

### Audio Feature Engineering
Extracting useful information from sounds. This can be done by sampling the audio and getting the amplitude to represent the audio in numeric format.
