# Data Preparation
There is always some cleaning that needs to be done before feeding it into a [[Machine Learning]] model. These models need to have numbers, no missing numbers and not have outliers for the best performance.

Before we can clean the data, we need to understand the data.

Data preparation is the process of transforming a dataset using different techniques to prepare it for [[Model Training]] and testing. In essence, we change the dataset so it is ready for machine learning.

If we feed a model unprepared data, it will not be good.


## Data Preparation methods:
- [[Categorical Encoding]]
- [[Feature Engineering]]
- [[Handling Missing Values]]


## Options for data preparation
- [[SageMaker]] and [[Jupyter]] Notebooks - adhoc
- [[Glue]] - reusable
