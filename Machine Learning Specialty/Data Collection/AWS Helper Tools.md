# AWS Helper Tools
## [[EMR]]
EMR is a fully managed [[Hadoop]] ecosystem. You pick and choose the libraries you want to run distributed computing.

In this case, we can use EMR to store data. If the data is there we can move it to [[S3]] if required.

## [[Athena]]
Serverless platform to run SQL queries on S3. Athena lets you set up a table in [[Glue]] data catalog and query it to output the results to S3 or a CSV.
