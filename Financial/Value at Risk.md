Value at Risk is a way of estimating the [[Financial Risk]] of a single day negative price movement. It has a [[Confidence Interval]] associated with it.

It is worth estimating a [[Normal Distribution]] of probabilities based on the returns to calculate the risk. This way you can end up with values that were not in the historical returns.
