Modern Portfolio Theory is where you generate a number of weighted [[Financial Portfolio]]s to find the portfolio with the weights where there is the highest expected return for a given level of [[Financial Risk]]. This is the [[Efficient Frontier]].


In analysing the data, you can use [[Covariance Shrinkage]] to remove large errors (the impact of extreme events). This is used to calculate the [[Efficient Covariance]] which is important for calculating [[Portfolio Weights]].
