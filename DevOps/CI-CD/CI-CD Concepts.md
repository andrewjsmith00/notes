When developing software, we want to be able to continuously and iteratively deliver fixes and features to meet the needs of the business. In doing so, we want to meet the needs of developers in writing software, and operations in having stable infrastructure.
This forms a continuous cycle of planning, developing, building, testing, deploying and then monitoring.

To best accomplish this, we can use the [[DevOps]] practices of [[Continuous Integration]], [[Continuous Delivery]] and [[Continuous Deployment]] to do this.
