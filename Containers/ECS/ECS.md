Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a [[Containers]] service for AWS. It is used to run [[Docker]] containers on either [[EC2]] or [[Fargate]]. It has a few native integrations with other AWS services such as [[Route 53]] and [[Application Load Balancer]].

It does not have the extensibility or open-source base of [[EKS]].
