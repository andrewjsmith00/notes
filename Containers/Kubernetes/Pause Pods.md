Pause Pods are [[Pod]]s that are designed to run with a negative [[Pod Priority]] on the cluster. This is done to overprovision a cluster that is using autoscaling. When there are enough Pause Pods pending, the cluster provisions new [[Worker Node]]s to schedule the pods. When any real workload comes along it has a higher priority than the Pause Pods, causing them to be evicted and allowing the new workloads to run.

The advantage of doing this is due to the extra capacity, the real workload scheduling is faster as there is not a need to wait for the new [[Worker Node]]s to be provisioned as it happens beforehand.
