# Docker
Docker is a platform that allows you to separate applications from your infrastructure to allow for quicker software delivery. With Docker you can manage your infrastructure in the same way you manage your applications. Docker allows you to significantly reduce delay between writing code and running it in production.

## The Docker Platform
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. This isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application so you do not need to rely on what is installed on the host.
