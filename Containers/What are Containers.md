# What are containers
Containers are about portable software. They allow you to run software on a variety of systems, including a developer's laptop. You want software to run reliably and consistently regardless of system
This speeds up deployment, simplifies automation and ensures the code can run consistently 

Like virtual machines, containers wrap your software in a standardised environment that allows it to run consistently on varied machines. Containers are smaller, use fewer resources and easier to automate.

Containers are essentially running the same as VMs except that they are running with less overhead.

VMs have the host OS. The VM also has a full copy of a complete additional operating system that runs. This is what has extra overhead. 

Containers have the host operating system which they use to run. They may have additional components to run but they do not need their own OS to run.

Containers are great for
- Software Portability
- Isolation
- Scaling
- Automation
- Efficient resource usage
