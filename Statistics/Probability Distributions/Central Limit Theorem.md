The central limit theorem says that the distribution of sample statistics (such as mean, standard deviation, etc.) is a [[Normal Distribution]]. The mean of the sample distribution is approximately the value for the population distribution. 

For example, the mean of a distribution of sample means is approximately the mean of the population distribution.
