A bootstrap distribution is a distribution created by calculating [[Sample Statistics]] on many replicates of samples. These samples are created by sampling with replacement from our collected data.

For example, if we have a sample of 10 items, we can collect a sample from here with replacement which means we may have duplicates. If we do this many times and compute some sample statistic on these values, we end up with a distribution of values.

Similar to [[Sampling Distribution]]s, we can use bootstrap distributions to estimate population parameters.
