A Sampling Distribution is a distribution created by collecting point estimates from many random samples. One way of accomplishing this is by collecting random samples from a dataset and calculating the mean from each.

The distribution follows a [[Normal Distribution]] and is centred around the mean of the population.

We calculate the sampling distribution to understand how the point estimate changes based on the values present.
