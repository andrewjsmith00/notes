The Central Limit Theorem states that:
- The [[Sampling Distribution]] of sample means becomes a [[Normal Distribution]] with more samples
- The range of values shrinks with more samples.

If you calculate the mean of all sample means in a sampling distribution, it approaches the mean of the population with more samples. 

The standard deviation of these distributions is called the standard error. It is roughly the value of the population [[Standard Deviation]] divided by the square root of the number of samples.
